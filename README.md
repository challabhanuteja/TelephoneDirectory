# TelephoneDirectory
This project have 2 classes:
1)ReadAndStore : this class stores the given name and mobile number of the person if that name or number is not present in phonebook.txt
if name or number is already present in the phonebook.txt then it will ask to enter another name or number respectively.
2)StoreInHashTable: this class stores all the names(key) and mobile numbers(value) into Hashtable collection in java. Later it will ask u to enter any name as input.
The output will be the mobile number of that person. If that name not exits in phonebook.txt then it will output "Name not found"
